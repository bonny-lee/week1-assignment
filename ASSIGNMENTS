#1. Write a function  count_vowels(word) that takes a word as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the word
def count_vowels(word):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    return sum(1 for char in word if char in vowels)

#2. Iterate through the following list of animals and print each one in all caps.

animals = ['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.upper())

#3. Write a program that iterates from 1 to 20, printing each number and whether it's odd or even.

for num in range(1, 21):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")

#4. Write a function sum_of_integers(a, b) that takes two integers as input from the user and returns their sum.

def sum_of_integers(a, b):
    return a + b

# To use the function with user input
a = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
print(f"The sum is: {sum_of_integers(a, b)}")
